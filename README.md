# diabetes_prediction
Project 4

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project will aim to identify the most crucial factors in predicting diabetes as well as using said factors to establish a more accurate predictive model. The dataset for this project covers 21 influential factors for determining if a person is at risk for diabetes. These twenty-one factors will be tested to determine the correlation between the factors and a personâ€™s propensity towards diabetes.  Each relevant discovery will be visualized accordingly.

### ANALYSIS

1. SPARK IMPORT

We started by uploading the cleaned data via spark and converted to a Pandas DataFrame as seen below.

2. Profile Report (Ydata Profiling)

We created a summary statistics report using the cleaned data as seen below.  This provided a lot of information about the columns and correlation between them.

2. TABLEAU

We used Tableau to visualize the cleaned data and compare it to the machine learning models discussed in the next section.

The Tableau workbook can be found at this site https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/leah.latham/viz/Diabetes_Prediction_Visuals_17000126037780/DiabetesData?publish=yes

3. MACHINE LEARNING
    * Neural Networks/KerasTuner <br>
        We ran four neural network models utilizing different parameters and units with different activation sequences.  We started with the original uncleaned dataset for model #1 and #2, with model #2 dropping a column.  Model #3 and model #4 utilized the cleaned dataset with model #4 utilizing KerasTuner to identify the best parameters.

    * Random Forests <br>
        We also ran two Random Forest models.  The first utilized all 21 features from the cleaned dataset.  We then used this model to identify Feature Importances.  Then we chose only the top 10 features from the Feature Importances analysis for the second Random Forest model.

    * KMeans
        We ran three KMeans models to compare the top four features, looking at BMI-age, BMI-income, and BMI-physical health.
